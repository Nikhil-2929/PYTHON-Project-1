Python Application Suite: English Dictionary &amp; Library Book Management System

This project demonstrates practical applications of Python programming by implementing two key applications:

1A: English Dictionary App

A command-line dictionary application that allows users to:

✅ Add new words with their meanings.

✅ Search for word definitions from a stored dictionary.

✅ Update existing words with new meanings.

✅ Store words and meanings using file serialization (words.txt).

This project focuses on file handling, serialization, and menu-driven programming in Python.

1B: Library Book Management System

A GUI-based Library Book Management System using Tkinter (Frontend) & SQLite (Backend) that allows users to:

✅ Add new books (Title, Author, Year, ISBN).

✅ Search books based on different criteria.

✅ Update or delete book records from the database.

✅ View all stored books in a list.

This project strengthens skills in GUI development, database management, and CRUD operations.

By implementing these applications, you will enhance your Python development skills and gain valuable portfolio-worthy projects
